# Alien Wish

### Goal ###

The goal of this project is to obtain / refresh Java and Android programming skills through creating simple and useful application. The point is to go through all stages from architecture and coding up to deployment on Google Play

### Idea ###

The idea of the application is to remind your friend / wife / child or even yourself about something that they promised to do. Imagine, you asking your friend to bring you a book and he tells "please, remind me in the evening". It may take years before you get this book. Or you could ask your friend to install AlienWish app on his phone and start it, nothing more. On your phone you open AlienWish, create a request with text "don't forget to take a book", set 8.00 pm and send it to your friend by choosing his name in the phone's address book. In the evening your friend gets notification about the book.

**Key features:**

* Notifications can be triggered not only by time, but also by location. Moreover, location may be set either as fixed coordinates or as keywords which are being searched on the map. Use case example for fixed location is you ask your friend to buy a screwdriver when he happens to be in a household goods shop near his house. Keywords might be used when you don't care in which shop he buy you a screwdriver, he will be getting notifications every time when he is near a suitable shop.
* Users should perform as little action as possible, especially ones who doing a favor. No registration, no other complications
* This app can also be used for setting notifications for yourself, you can imagine that this app is your own reminder where your friends can add events (at least as long as you don't block them)
* There are three main ways to show notifications which are waiting for triggering: on the calendar, on the map and as a list
* Notifications are short simple text that is easy to enter and read on a smartphone

**Distinctions**

* This is not a *ToDo list*. ToDo list have to somehow manage tasks, like changing status to *done* and so on. We don't have this. Notification fires and this is it.
* This is not a *Calendar*. Core functionality of calendar is to show events on a calendar. We also have events that are triggered by location and they can only be shown on a map.

*ToDo list* and *Calendar* functionalities are close to AlienWish app and in the future some incorporation is possible, as well as integration with existing *Calendar* and *ToDo lists* applications.
